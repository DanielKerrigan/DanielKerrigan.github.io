<p>
	I am a computer science Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, where I am advised by <a
		href="http://enrico.bertini.io">Enrico Bertini</a
	>. I am interested in information visualization and its applications relating to machine learning.
	Before our lab moved to Northeastern, I was a Ph.D. student at NYU. Prior to grad school, I worked
	as a software development engineer at Amazon Robotics and did my undergraduate studies at Notre
	Dame.
