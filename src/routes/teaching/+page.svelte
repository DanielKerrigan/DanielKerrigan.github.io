	<h3>Information Visualization</h3>
	<p>
		I spent five semesters as a teaching assistant for NYU Tandon's Information Visualization
		course. I have developed <a href="https://observablehq.com/@nyuvis?tab=collections"
			>collections of Observable notebooks</a
		>
		to help teach students how to build visualizations with D3. The notebooks contain
		<a href="https://observablehq.com/collection/@nyuvis/guides-and-examples"
			>tutorials and examples</a
		>,
		<a href="https://observablehq.com/collection/@nyuvis/practice-exercises">practice exercises</a>,
		and <a href="https://observablehq.com/collection/@nyuvis/exercises">homework assignments</a>.

		I spent one semester as a teaching assistant for Northeastern's Visualization for Machine

	<h3>Online D3 Help</h3>
	<p>
		Outside of class, I enjoy helping people learn D3 online. I've answered over 75 questions about
		D3 on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/5016634/dan">Stack Overflow</a> and the
		<a href="https://talk.observablehq.com/u/danielkerrigan/summary">Observable forums</a>.
