              <h2><a href="https://slicelens.vercel.app">SliceLens</a></h2>
              <p>SliceLens is one of my current research projects at NYU. It is a tool for exploring machine learning datasets and model predictions. Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/nyuvis/SliceLens">GitHub repo</a> for more info.</p>

            <div id="observable">
              <h2><a href="https://observablehq.com/@nyuvis?tab=collections">Observable</a></h2>
              <p>I have developed collections of Observable notebooks for NYU's Information Visualization course to help teach students how to build visualizations with D3.</p>

            <div id="nutrition">
                <h2><a href="bytes-of-nutrition">Bytes of Nutrition</a></h2>
                <p>Bytes of Nutrition was my class project from the undergraduate Data Visualization course that I took at ND. It is an interactive visualization of nutrition data. This project later became the basis for a poster accepted to IEEE VIS 2017. If you are interested in the final version, look at the <a href="poster.pdf">poster</a>, watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/230838162">demo video</a> and read the <a href="NutritionBytesFinal.pdf">extended abstract</a>.</p>

            <div id="tracelink">
                <h2><a href="trace-vis">Traceability Visualization</a></h2>
                <p>This interactive visualization was made while I was working in the HCI Lab at Notre Dame. It shows the development of the Maven project and how the git commits for the project connect to bugs, improvements, and classes in the code. You can interact with the visualization through the filtering options on the left or by hovering over and clicking on the nodes. It might take some time for the data to load for this visualization.</p>
